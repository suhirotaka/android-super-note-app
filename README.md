# Noteapp Proto

Noteapp Proto is a prototype of android notebook app which is written by native JAVA language.

Items in the notebook are organised in tree structure. I intentionally leave flaw in UI design so that you can learn how important UI design is and try to improve UI experience.

## Requirements
Android 4.2(JELLY_BEAN_MR1) or higher

## Motivation
We can learn how important UI experience is from this app. Though this app has no flaw in functionality, you would find it difficult to use this app. We can get a chance to experiment how we can improve UI experience.
